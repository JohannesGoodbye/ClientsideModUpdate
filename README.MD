# Modpack Updater Script

This repository contains a Python script I use to update and download mods for a private modpack played with friends.

## Important Notice

This script is **not intended for public use** and likely won’t be useful outside of my private modpack setup. It is tailored specifically for that environment.

I publish the full source code here purely for transparency, so anyone curious can verify it does only what it says — manage mod downloads for a private modpack. 

If you stumbled across this repo while browsing my other projects, please be aware this tool is not designed as a general-purpose mod manager.

Thanks for understanding!
